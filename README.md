# ColonyQuest
ColonyQuest is a resource gathering/sandbox game.

It is partially inspired by the [Folding Ideas Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6i5Ylu0mgM) 
and what if we actually thought about how the colonialism inherent impacts play rather than wave the
magic want and say it doesn't exist.

Other influences are
1. Factorio
2. Oxygen Not Included
3. Satisfactory
